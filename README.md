               is introduced. It, along with several alternative models, is
               tested on data from the European Union. The new model, which
               allows for contingent forecasts and for generating confidence
               intervals around predictions, outperforms competing models in
               most tests despite the absence of variance on a critical
               variable in all but nine cases. The more proximate the political
               setting of the issues is to the new model{\^a}‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s underlying
               theory of competitive and potentially coercive politics, the
               better the new model does relative to other models tested in the
